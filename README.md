# Valheim User Interface Tweaks

This modpack comprises a selection of my personal favorates for tweaking the Valheim User Interface (UI). 

This is not meant to be something like "project Auga" overhauling the whole UI and by that requiring all other mods to interface with it, but this just takes some rather simple mods I prefer for having a better user experience playing this game. This also does not include UI changes that require high performance PCs, these changes should not impact performance.

The credits for the mods selected for this mod pack go back to the original mod authors. I do just present those mods in a nice pre-combined and pre-configured way.

## Features

* Game clock (24h format)
* Hovering over things shows stats or contents (for chests)
* Advanced UI editing via "Better UI" mod
    * I did pre-edit the UI to get a better display of health and stamina, if you don't like it this way, you can change it
    * Note: I changed the key for editing the UI to "+", so press "ESC" and then "+" to be able to edit
* Building UI improvements by the "Euler's Ruler", but just using health and stability from that one

## Change log

* 1.0.2 -> changed key again
* 1.0.1 -> deactivated some better ui skill settings, deactivated some euler's ruler settings
* 1.0.0 -> initial creation
